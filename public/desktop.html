          <b>A Heart from Space</b> is a tool for collective GPS drawing. To draw together, gather a group of of people, and visit this website on a mobile phone.

        <iframe width="100%" height="400px" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/473022183" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br>
        <p>
        The website draws a line between the GPS positions of the online users in your group. The participants collectively determine the shape of the heart, adjusting their positions relative to the group.

        <p>
        The project is an exploration of the ability for the internet to support collective action. The independent actions of each user in response to the view of the collective refines the image, creating a metaphor of independent actors working together to achieve collective aims through interfaces that help them understand their interconnected nature.

        <b>About</b> <br>
          <p>
          The project was created by artist <a href="http://www.jonathanchomko.com/">Jonathan Chomko</a>, inspired by a conversation with Yo-Yo Ma. Chomko and Ma met in 2018 during a performance of Chomko's work <a href="http://www.grindruberairbnb.exposed/"> www.grindruberairbnb.exposed</a>, which leads participants in to perform and gesture together via their smartphones. Afer explaining the operation of the project to Mr Ma, he then asked if the system might be able to support the coordination of hundreds of thousands of people all across the midwest to form a heart that would be visible from space. <br><br>
          A Heart from Space is a scaled down version of this vision, allowing smaller groups to explore moving together via the network. By scaling down the experience, the experience becomes one of negotiation and collaboration, through the internet. This experience de-centers the individual, placing them instead in relation to the group, and challenging them to achieve a shared task.
          <br><br>
          The combined hurdles of technical complexity and the dynamics of group behaviour make this task sometimes challenging, and the hearts that are created reflect this challenge. The incompleteness of the shapes speaks to the difficulty that collaboration entails, and provides a grounding to the optimism of the project. <br><br>
